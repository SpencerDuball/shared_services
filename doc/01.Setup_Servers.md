# Infrastructure

My home network is running using a [Turing PI 2.5.1](https://turingpi.com/product/turing-pi-2-5/) cluster board with 4 [Turing RK1 32GB](https://turingpi.com/product/turing-rk1/?attribute_ram=32+GB) cluster boards. These boards are ARM chips which are great for low power usage, and have an impressive amount of compute with 8 Cores - 32GB RAM - 6 TOPS NPU each. To put into perspective how much compute this is, if I were to purchase this on [fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/about/pricing/#started-fly-machines) it would cost:

```math
4 \times (\text{performance-8x 32Gb @ \$328.04/month}) = \$1,312.16/\text{month} = \$15,745.92/\text{year}
```

or on AWS it would cost:

```math
4 \times (\text{m6g.2xlarge 32Gb @ \$225.08/month}) = \$900.32/\text{month} = \$10,803.84/\text{year}
```

## Network

The network is a 1Gbps (125MB/s) fiber connection to the house with an Eero 6 router. The Turing Pi 2.5 has 2 1Gbps ethernet ports, and only one of them is plugged into the Eero, so max network traffic is:

```math
\text{1Gbps or 125MB/s}
```

## Server

Each of the Turing RK1 compute modules is running Ubuntu 24.04. The following commands were used to set up each container from fresh Ubuntu install.

### SSH Keys Only

To secure access to each of the machines, an SSH key was added for login and basic auth was turned off.

1. Add my public SSH key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on a new line.
2. Update the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` making the following changes:

```bash
PasswordAuthentication no
UsePAM no
```

3. Restart the `ssh` server

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### Install Docker

Install [Docker for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) ensuring to use Docker's official GPG key and adding it to the Apt sources. This ensures that each server can have the latest official releases and doesn't need to wait for APT repositories to update to the latest Docker version.

Refer to the website linked above for full instructions, providing the command that were run here for future reference:

1. Set up Docker's `apt` repository.

```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

2. Install the Docker packages.

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

3. Add your user to the docker group permissions

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
```

### Setup a Docker Swarm

The instructions used for [setting up a Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/) distilled into the following actions outlined here:

1. Docker mentions that fixed IPs should be used for manager nodes on a Docker swarm, in the Eero app I have set all 4 machines to have a fixed static IP. One of these nodes will be a worker node, but setting all to have a static IP is just easier to manage.

2. Open protocols and ports between the hosts

   a. Open necessary ports with `iptables`

   ```bash
   # Allow port 2377 (TCP) for Docker Swarm manager node communication
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2377 -j ACCEPT

   # Allow port 7946 (TCP/UDP) for node discovery and communication
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 7946 -j ACCEPT
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 7946 -j ACCEPT

   # Allow port 4789 (UDP) for the overlay network traffic
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 4789 -j ACCEPT
   ```

   b. Allow IPSec ESP Traffic (For Encrypted Overlay Networks)

   ```bash
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -p esp -j ACCEPT
   ```

   c. Only allow encrypted UDP packets to be sent over port 4789, this means when creating overlay networks (aka deploying a stack with an overlay network) the `--opt encrypted` flag is absolutely required.

   ```bash
   # block unencrypted UDP packets on port 4789
   sudo iptables -I INPUT -p udp --dport 4789 -m policy --dir in --pol none -j DROP
   ```

   d. Customize the default ingress network to use encryption. This actually cannot be done until the docker swarm has been created. Continue to step 3 where this action will be taken.

3. Create the leader manager. **Done only for one manager node, not all machines!**

```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER-IP>
```

4. Remove and create the new ingress network with encryption (**only done once, ingress network is shared on a swarm**).

```bash
# remove the default ingress network (must be done after swarm is created)
sudo docker network rm ingress

# create the new ingress network with encryption enabled
sudo docker network create --driver=overlay --ingress --opt=encrypted ingress
```

5. For the other two nodes that will be managers (3 manager/workers, 1 worker) join the swarm. And then from a manager node, promote that node to a manager:

```bash
# join the node as a worker (run from new machine), command comes from the leader manager
sudo docker swarm join --token  SWMTKN-1-49nj1cmql0jkz5s954yi3oex3nedyz0fb0xx14ie39trti4wxv-8vxv8rssmk743ojnwacrr2e7c 192.168.99.100:2377

# promote the worker to a manager node (run from manager node)
sudo docker node ls # get the worker ID
sudo docker node promote <WORKER_ID>
```

### Networking

When you enable **encrypted overlay networks** in Docker Swarm, **only** the specific overlay networks that you explicitly configure with encryption will have their traffic encrypted. This means that:

1. **Ingress network encryption**: Encrypting the **ingress** network ensures that traffic entering your Swarm through the default ingress network (used for routing mesh and external access) is encrypted. However, **this does not automatically encrypt traffic between other services** running inside Swarm on other overlay networks.

2. **Other overlay networks**: If you create additional **custom overlay networks**, you must **explicitly enable encryption** for each of them when creating them (by using the --opt encrypted flag). If you don't do this, traffic between services on these networks **will not be encrypted**, even if they are running across different Swarm nodes.

#### Why Encrypt the Ingress Network?

The ingress network handles external requests coming into the Swarm, often exposing services to the public internet or untrusted networks. Since VXLAN (the protocol used for overlay networks in Swarm) does not have built-in authentication, it's possible for malicious actors to inject packets into port **4789** and interfere with network traffic. Encrypting the ingress network:

- Ensures that ingress traffic is encrypted when traversing untrusted networks (going between nodes).
- Prevents unauthorized access to ingress traffic (from malicious actors potentially within your swarm).
- Helps secure externally accessible services (encryption ensures only the intended recipient in the swarm gets the traffic decrypted).
- **Note:** If you have a trusted network, encrypting the ingress network is probably not needed. This mainly protects against malicious services/actors within your swarm network from viewing public traffic passed to the target service.

#### Key Takeaways:

- Encrypting **only the ingress network** protects traffic coming **into** the Swarm but does **not** automatically encrypt service-to-service communication.
- To encrypt **all inter-service communication**, you must enable encryption on each overlay network that services use.
- The **iptables rule** (iptables -I INPUT -m udp --dport 4789 -m policy --dir in --pol none -j DROP) ensures that only encrypted VXLAN packets are accepted, preventing untrusted, unencrypted packets from entering the Swarm network (malicious packet injection).
